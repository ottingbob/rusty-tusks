#### Extra info and context


Walruses are large marine mammals that belong to the pinniped family, which also includes seals and sea lions. They are primarily found in the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Here are some key points about where walruses typically live:

###### Geographic Range

Walruses have a circumpolar distribution, inhabiting coastal areas of the Arctic Ocean and its adjoining seas. Their range spans from the eastern coast of Greenland across the northern coasts of North America and Eurasia, extending as far west as the Bering Strait.

###### Preferred Habitat

Walruses rely on sea ice as a platform for various activities such as resting, giving birth, and finding food. During the summer, when the sea ice retreats, they typically migrate to shallow continental shelves and coastal areas. These regions provide opportunities for bottom-feeding on benthic organisms like clams, snails, and other invertebrates.

###### Specific Locations
Some notable locations where walruses are known to inhabit include the Bering Sea, the Chukchi Sea, the Laptev Sea, the Kara Sea, and the Hudson Bay.

###### Species
>   __Atlantic Walrus__ (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus): This species is found in the Atlantic Ocean, particularly in the coastal regions of northeastern Canada and western Greenland.

>   __Pacific Walrus__ (Odobenus rosmarus divergens): The Pacific walrus is located in the Pacific Ocean, primarily in the seas around Alaska, Russia, and the northern parts of Canada.

>   __Laptev Walrus__ (Odobenus rosmarus laptevi): This subspecies or population of walruses is restricted to the Laptev Sea in the Arctic Ocean, near the coast of Siberia.
